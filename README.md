# AGCT-Relational-Dynamic-Database
Bachelor Final Project (Application to Manage Tourism Houses with relational dynamic databses)

This repository is used to mantain the necessary code in PHP, JS and CSS necesssary to the development.

We are using Wordpress as a Web Framework.

This project was being developed by Fábio Luís aka fcl-93 and Vítor Baptista aka vmcbaptista under supervision of Dr. David.

##Note: we have a big amount of commits because we used github webwooks to pull new additions on the code to our main server##
